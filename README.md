# DIY-Toml
I try to find some simple TOML parser with customizable features, but cannot find one.

Now I'm making it myself.

I'm starting to hate my life.

### tf is this?
DIY-Toml is simple TOML parser written in Kotlin.

### Did you try to find some alternative?
Yes, and I don't want to read more docs to write TOML.
